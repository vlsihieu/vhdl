WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator IC10/Mrom_MA_SO<3>11 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer IC10/Mrom_MA_SO<3>1_f6/MUXF5.I1.  There is a conflict for
   the GYMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           181 out of   9,312    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               992 out of   9,312   10%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            615 out of   4,656   13%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     615 out of     615 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     615   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,085 out of   9,312   11%
    Number used as logic:               992
    Number used as a route-thru:         93

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 31 out of     158   19%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.97

Peak Memory Usage:  214 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  5 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
